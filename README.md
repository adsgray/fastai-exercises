# course.fast.ai exercise
Make a neural net that classifies the MNIST handwritten digits set.
Crazy that this dumb code can make a 90% accurate classifier. And this was trained on my chromebook.

# todo
1. DONE pull samples without replacement 
2. implement Learning Rate Finder
3. implement a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. (tried weight decay, no idea how to tune it)
